Hi there!
I'm Ollie (Oliver) Ford, a freelance data scientist | Machine Learning scientist and overall Deep Learning enthusiast. I also **love** tea. 

My interest in solving real-world problems through engineering and ‘learning how to learn’ are the fundamental reasons that I gravitated towards Artificial Intelligence. 

I have a strong background in machine learning engineering, design, data science and an interdisciplinary perspective originating from my bachelor’s degree crossing multiple disciplines in science, technology, humanities and the arts. 

Recently, I graduated from the University of Edinburgh with a MSc degree in Advanced Design Informatics with distinction.
